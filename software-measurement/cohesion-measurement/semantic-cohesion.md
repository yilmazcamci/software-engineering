# Semantic Cohesion

Assessing whether a class is a whole semantically.

It's possible to have a class with highly internal and syntactic cohesion but little semantic cohesion. We, sometimes, may merge semantically cohesive classes to give an externally semantically nonsensical class while retaining internal syntactic cohesion.

## Semantic complexity metrics

Evaluating a class whether it is an abstract data type in the sense of being complete and also coherent, i.e., it must contain everything that one would expect and nothing else.
