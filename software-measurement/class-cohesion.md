# Class Cohesion

## Purpose

- Not to answer a given class is cohesive or not-cohesive, but also give a degree for each version which can be used for design comparison.

## How

- By manipulating class elements, such as attributes, methods, and method parameters.

## Class cohesion metrics groups

- Interface-based metrics
- Code-based metrics

## Code-based metrics

- Disjoint component-based metrics count the number of disjoint sets of methods or attributes in a given class
- Pairwise connection-based metrics compute cohesion as a function of number connected and disjoint method pairs.
- Connection magnitude-based metrics count the accessing methods per attribute and indirectly find an attribute-sharing index in terms of the count (instead of computing directly attribute-sharing between methods)
- Decomposition-based metrics compute cohesion in terms of recursive decompositions of a given class. The decompositions are generated by removal of pivotal elements that keep the class connected.
