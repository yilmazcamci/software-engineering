# Effort Estimation

## Deriving project duration from Use Case Point (UCP)

`Duration = UCP * PF`

where `PF` is Productivity Factor

## Productivity factor (PF)

Person working hours per use case point

We can assume PF from experience and statical data of past projects. If both sources are not available, considering a value from 15 to 30.

### Schneider and Winters approach

Counting E1-E6 that have the perceived impact less than 3 and those among E7 & E8 with the impact greater than 3. If the total count is:
- 2 or less, assume PF 20 hours
- 3 or 4, assume PF 28 hours
- Greater than 4, put project on hold until some environmental factors can be improved

## Considerations

- The actual working time of a person is always less than 40 hours per week. A sensible assumption may be 30 hours per week, excluding corporate overhead, such as chatting, answering email, attending meetings, and so on.
