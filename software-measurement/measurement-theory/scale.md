# Scales in Measurement Theory

## Types

- Nominal
- Ordinal
- Interval
- Ratio
- Absolute

### Nominal scale

Grouping subjects into categories.

Key requirements of a category:
- Mutually exclusive: a measured attribute can be classified into one and only one category.
- Jointly exhaustive: all categories together should cover all possible values of the attribute.

### Ordinal scale

Comparing subjects in order.

### Interval scale

Indicating the exact differences between measurement points. The zero point of an interval scale doesn't mean nothing, absence, or empty (i.e., absolute or non-arbitrary zero). Thus, we can use addition and subtraction to interval scale data.

### Ratio scale

A special case of an interval scale where its zero point is absolute. Thus, we can apply four basic arithmetic operations on interval scale data.

### Absolute scale

There is only one way to measure a property.
